# Commercial License Agreement

**English** | 🌐 [繁體中文](./LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.zh-TW.md)

## CEX Web3 Platform - Commercial License

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is offered by [Your Company Name] ("Licensor") 
for the CEX Web3 Platform software and any associated documentation ("Software").

---

## Why Commercial License?

The CEX Web3 Platform is released under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)**.
While this allows free use, the AGPL requires that:

1. Any modifications to the Software must be released under the same AGPL license
2. If you offer the Software as a network service (SaaS), you must provide the complete 
   source code to your users
3. You must preserve all copyright and license notices

If these requirements conflict with your business needs, a Commercial License allows you to:

- ✅ Use the Software in proprietary/closed-source products
- ✅ Offer the Software as a SaaS without releasing source code
- ✅ Modify the Software without publishing your modifications
- ✅ Remove attribution requirements (except for third-party components)
- ✅ Receive priority technical support (optional add-on)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need a commercial license for internal use?
**A:** If you're using the Software purely internally within your organization and not 
offering it as a service to third parties, the AGPL may be sufficient. However, if you've 
made modifications you don't wish to release, you'll need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I evaluate the software before purchasing?
**A:** Yes! You can use the AGPL version for evaluation purposes. If you later decide 
to use it commercially without AGPL compliance, obtain a commercial license before 
going to production.

### Q: What if I've already deployed under AGPL and want to switch?
**A:** Contact us. We can provide a commercial license retroactively, though you'll 
need to remove any public source code releases you may have made.

### Q: Are there any ongoing fees?
**A:** The initial license is perpetual for the version purchased. Annual renewal 
(optional) provides access to updates and continued support.
